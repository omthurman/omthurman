### My name is Owen Thurman and I make cool stuff


ðŸ”­ I work as a data analyst at Waterford Property Company, a leading firm in the workforce housing industry, with a portfolio valued at over 3 billion dollars. I specialize in the integration of AI and machine learning within the real estate industry. I am currently spearheading several exciting projects, both for the company and my own personal pursuits. 


âš¡ One that is particularly exciting is my work web-scraping financial data and processing it with sophisticated financial models in order to forecast the future of real estate distress in the entire world. As you can see, the outcome in Phoenix is grim.

As a data analyst with expertise in AI and machine learning, I have developed a comprehensive data pipeline that enables me to produce actionable intelligence from start to finish. This pipeline includes several key steps:

Web scraping: I use Python to gather information from various sources on the web.

Data processing: I process the collected data into a usable format for further analysis.

Data storage: I design and implement SQL-based databases to store the processed data.

Machine learning and AI integration: For more advanced solutions, I incorporate various machine learning and AI techniques to further analyze the data. (Keras, Scit-Kit Learn, Tensorflow)

Visualization: Finally, I create visualizations of the data using Tableau to provide key decision-makers with easy-to-understand insights.

I am responsible for managing the entire data pipeline, from web scraping to data visualization. My expertise in Python, SQL, machine learning, and AI, allows me to gather, process, store, analyze, and visualize data in an efficient and effective manner.
