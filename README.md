### Hi everyone, my name is Owen Thurman. A data analyst @ Waterford Property Company that specializes in AI/ML. 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several exciting projects, both for my company and personal passion projects. 


âš¡ One that is particularly exciting is my work web-scraping financial data and processing it with sophisticated financial models in order to forecast the future of real estate distress in the entire world. As you can see, the outcome in Phoenix is grim.

âš¡ I own the entire data pipeline, and produce actionable intelligence from start to finish. 
      --> Typically I first web scraped information using Python
      --> I then process it into a usable format
      --> Next I store the data inside the SQL based databases that I have designed and implemented
      --> On more sophisticated solutions I introduce various Machine Learning and Artifical intelligence solutions at this stage
      --> Then finally I produce visualizations for key decision makers, typically this is done in Tableau.

A big part of the engineering problems I work on revolve around machine learning and artificial intelligence. Examples include
